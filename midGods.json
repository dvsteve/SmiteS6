Alternatively, you can choose to finish Warlock's Staff prior to starting your shoes, if you'd prefer.  This is an individual playstyle choice.  Finishing shoes first will give you faster movement in lane and around the map.  Finishing Warlock's Staff first will allow you to begin stacking it as quickly as possible, but will make you a slower target for the enemy jungler, in the beginning of the game.",

Start with this ability at level one, but don't select it until you're in lane ready to use the ability.  This way you'll have the option of leveling up your third ability if needed to escape any enemy invasions.  Assuming you took Piercing Cold at level one, put a point into your second ability, Rune of the Hunt, at level two.  At level three, you can choose between putting a second point into Piercing Cold, or taking a level of your third ability, Permafrost.  Place a point into the other skill at level four.  At level five, put a point into your ultimate, Winter's Grasp.  Beyond fifth level, you should generally level your abilities in the following priority:  1>2>4>3.  A penetration build is recommended for Skadi.",

"description":"When starting in the hunter role, you'll generally start in your duo lane with your support.  If you win lane early, you can look to invade the enemy's purple or red buffs.  If you're winning lane after the second wave, you'll be able to hit level two after killing just the two small creeps in the enemy purple camp.  You can use this to your advantage if you invade purple and the enemy team moves into the jungle to contest, as they will still be level one.  Be mindful of this if you find yourself being pushed under your own tower, as the enemy team will have this same advantage.",
