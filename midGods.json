"description":"Ideally, you should try to remain in lane at the start of the game until you can back and build full Shoes of the Magi.  Alternatively, you can choose to finish Warlock's Staff prior to starting your shoes, if you'd prefer.  This is an individual play style choice.  Finishing shoes first will give you faster movement in lane and around the map.  Finishing Warlock's Staff first will allow you to begin stacking it as quickly as possible, but will make you a slower target for the enemy jungler, in the beginning of the game.",
