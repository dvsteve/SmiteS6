"description":"Begin the game in Achilles' unarmored stance.  Your primary focus when leveling will be Achilles's first ability, Shield of Achilles.  Start with this ability at level 1, then take a point in his third ability, Combat Dodge, at level 2.  At level 3, choose a second point in Shield of Achilles, and then put a point into his second ability, Radiant Glory, at level 4.  At level 5, put a point into his ultimate ability, Fatal Strike.  Beyond fifth level, you should level your abilities in the following priority:  1>3>2>4.  In the jungle role, Achilles should spend most of the game in his unarmored stance, only donning his armor in the late game if you feel like you need the extra protections and health to deal with end game burst damage.",

You can use this to your advantage if you invade purple and the enemy team moves into the jungle to contest, as they will still be level one.  Be mindful of this if you find yourself being pushed under your own tower, as the enemy team will have this same advantage.",
