If you find yourself laning against a magical opponent, choosing to build a magical defense item like Runic Shield or Genji's Guard, before going into physical resistance, may be preferable to standard builds.",

"description":"Your primary focus while leveling will be Anhur's second ability, Impale.  Start with this ability at level one, but wait until you're in lane and ready to use the ability before selecting it.  This way, if you get invaded, you'll have the option to early level your leap as an escape.  Assuming you took Impale at level one, put a point into your first ability, Shifting Sands, at level two.  You can then put a point into your third ability, Disperse, at level three, following up with a second point into Impale at level 4.  At level five, put a point into your ultimate, Desert Fury.  Beyond fifth level, you should generally level your abilities in the following priority:  4>2>1>3.  A penetration build is recommended for Anhur.",
