"description":"Your primary focus while leveling will be Skadi's first ability, Piercing Cold.  Start with this ability at level one, but don't select it until you're in lane ready to use the ability.  This way you'll have the option of leveling up your third ability if needed to escape any enemy invasions.  Assuming you took Piercing Cold at level one, put a point into your second ability, Rune of the Hunt, at level two.  At level three, you can choose between putting a second point into Piercing Cold, or taking a level of your third ability, Permafrost.  Place a point into the other skill at level four.  At level five, put a point into your ultimate, Winter's Grasp.  Beyond fifth level, you should generally level your abilities in the following priority:  1>2>4>3.  A penetration build is recommended for Skadi.",
