"Description":"Your primary focus while leveling will be Ah Muzen Cab's second ability, Swarm.  Start with this ability at level 1 and put a point into your third ability, Honey, at level two.  This will help your early wave clear by placing Honey under the enemy minion wave and casting Swarm over it.  At level three, you should put a point into your first ability, Hive.  A tip for Hive placement in the duo lane is to place one inside the purple buff camp, against the wall, so that its area of effect range reaches into your lane.  This will allow you to use the Hive to activate Bees! with less chance of the Hive being easily cleared by your opponents.  At level 4, you will want to place a second point into your second ability, Swarm, and putting one point into your ultimate, Stinger, at level five.  Beyond fifth level, you should generally level your abilities in the following priority:  2>1>3>4.  Ah Muzen Cab works will with either crit or penetration builds.",

This way, if you get invaded, you'll have the option to early level your leap as an escape.  Assuming you took Impale at level one, put a point into your first ability, Shifting Sands, at level two.  You can then put a point into your third ability, Disperse, at level three, following up with a second point into Impale at level 4.  At level five, put a point into your ultimate, Desert Fury.  Beyond fifth level, you should generally level your abilities in the following priority:  4>2>1>3.  A penetration build is recommended for Anhur.",
